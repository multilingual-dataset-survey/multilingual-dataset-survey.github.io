Welcome to the multilingual dataset survey! You can view our paper at [arxiv/github]. 

Our survey examines characteristics of 156 multilingual labeled NLP datasets*, each covering at least one non-English language*. We manually annotate how they are created---including input text and label sources and tools used to build them---and what they study---tasks they address and motivations for their creation. This website aims to keep track of the state of multilingual resources and illustrate disparities for future researchers to focus on. To view all the papers we surveyed or to view the full annotation and a description of our annotation scheme, please see [‘full survey’ tab link].

We also have macro and micro-level suggestions such as funding suggestion, direction suggestion, [more] to the NLP community and to individual researchers for future multilingual data development. Please see [tab link] and [paper link] for more details.
